# cattle_druid

This is a web service created to work in combination with druid, able to react to incoming webhooks (from druid) by downloading the new files, converting them to linked data, and uploading the new graphs to druid.

cattle_druid is a spin-off from [cattle](http://cattle.datalegend.net/).
